In brief, the mummification process may be summarized as follows: extract, sterilize, dehydrate, perfume, seal, tag, and stock.
  All were done ceremoniously and with due respect to the dead body. The viscera were extracted through an incision about 10 inches long, 
  usually made in the left side of the abdomen. Through this incision, all the “floating” contents of the abdominal cavity,
  namely, the stomach, the liver, the spleen, and the intestines, were removed but the kidneys were left in place.
